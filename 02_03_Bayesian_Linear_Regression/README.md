## Important requirement for the exercise

Please install [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/)  
and then follow the guide to set up a virtual environment and install PyMC as recommended on the [PyMC Website](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/installation.html#installation).  

Otherwise PyMC is super slow and inefficient!
