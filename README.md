## Structure

The exercises are structured into six topics, with each topic beeing discussed over two sessions. First you will get a theoretical overview of the topic and a Jupiter Notebook with practical tasks. In the following session, we will discuss and solve the tasks. On StudOn, you will find the slides for the different topics, while the tasks as well as the solutions will be uploaded to this repository.
