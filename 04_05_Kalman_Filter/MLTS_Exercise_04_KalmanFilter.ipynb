    "## Task: Implement a Kalman Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "To help Bob, let's first implement the Kalman filtering for a simple object tracking application.  \n",
    "Kalman filter (KF) is an optimal estimation problem where we have linear and Gaussian systems. These two properties are central to the KF, since they allow us to estimate the integrals and other computations analytically. \n",
    "\n",
    "The system includes prediction and observation models. In a tracking object problem, the prediction model can be defined by e.g. physical rules that give the relation between position of the object and its acceleration during time. Observations can be obtained by a type of a sensor, e.g. GPS, that can indicate the position of the object. It is easy to imagine that for a real-world application, we have to take into account noisy models. In KF, we model the noises for both models with Gaussian density (distribution). We are interested to combine these two models (sources of information), in order to optimally estimate the object position.\n",
    "\n",
    "KF is a probabilistic method. We have to estimate several probability densities such as predictive and filtering density. The good news is that, since we assumed the system is Gaussian and linear, all these densities become a Gaussian density. One can define a Gaussian density by estimating its first two moments namely mean and variance.  Hence, the computation of, e.g. filtering density at a certain point, boils down to the computation of its mean and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KF algorithm is recursive. We compute the required densities (predictive and filtering density) once at a time for the whole trajectory of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a brief intuition behind the KF. For finding the exact explanation or formulation, please refer to your lecture slides or to the book of “Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective” by Kevin Murphy."
